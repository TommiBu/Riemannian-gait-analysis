# Riemannian Gait Analysis Framework

A Python computational tool for analyzing human gait dynamics using Riemannian geometry and manifold learning on Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices.

This repository contains the source code and proof-of-concept data for the research paper comparing linear (Euclidean) and non-linear (Riemannian) metric sensitivity in biomechanical analysis.

## Overview
Current Euclidean approaches often fail to capture the intrinsic non-linear geometric structure of human movement. This framework transforms raw kinematic data (pose estimation JSONs) into a Riemannian manifold to provide physically meaningful metrics for diagnostics and machine learning.

Key capabilities:
* Transformation of joint coordinates into covariance matrices (SPD manifold).
* Calculation of Geodesic Distance, Riemann Variance, and Smoothness.
* Direct comparison with baseline Euclidean metrics (velocity, path length).
* Visualization of metric divergence across different gait speeds.
